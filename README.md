# UNCP - Un-copy (Duplicate File Detection)

A tool to help you de-duplicate your data.

## Features

- **Multiple similarity metrics** such as exact content hashing, perceptual hashing, and text diffing
- **Asynchronous scanning** for responsive UI and immediate access to discovered files and relationships
- **High-performance file analysis** â€” speed is a top priority guiding development
- **Builds a graph of file relationships** for flexible querying
- **Data-oriented design** backed by Polars DataFrames and a custom system scheduler
- **Parquet cache format** allowing for analysis in other data analytics tools
- **Multiple ways to use**, including as a Rust library, CLI, GUI, and TUI.
- **Cross-platform support** (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Installation

## LLM Usage Disclaimer

The formal [Design Document](DESIGN.md) and initial implementation of this
project was effectively vibe-coded using the Augment Code plugin for CLion,
as a way for me to quickly get something working and test the limits of the
vibe coding approach myself. I may continue to use LLMs for some of the work
on this project, but not quite to the extent that I did for the initial work.
